# Predicting_Heart_Disease
This was my finial paper for my Harvard Data Science Certification. This paper used machine learning to predict if a patient had heart disease or not. 

There are two sets of papers in this repo

The first one is Heart_Disease_Predictions, this was the paper I turned in for my final.

I later made some improvements to that paper, the improved paper is the Heart_Disease_Kaggle.
