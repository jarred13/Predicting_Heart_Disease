# Predicting Heart Disease

# Overview

This notebook uses machine learning to predict if a patient has heart disease or not. Ten models were created and compared including an ensemble. The best model was able to predict with a F1 score of .91. This notebook is hosted on Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jarredpriester/heart-disease-predictions-using-a-ml-ensemble-in-r

# Purpose of the Project
First, this paper is my final paper for my Harvard Data Science Professional Certificate. Second, practice makes perfect! Third, I would like to know more about heart disease and how to prevent it, if possible.

# What Did I Learn
This project allowed me to take everything I have learned in my Harvard classes and put it all together in a data science project. I gained more experience with R and the caret library by using 10 models in this project. I learned that the type of chest pain, number of major vessels cleared, and the type of defects were the most important features when trying to predict heart disease.

# Dataset Used
We will be analyzing the heart disease dataset from University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset consists of 14 different features and 303 observations.
